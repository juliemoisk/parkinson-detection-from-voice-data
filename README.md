# Parkinson detection from voice data

## Description

This project aims to implement machine learning techniques to analyze voice recordings and detect the presence of Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder that affects movement. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the disease using voice data, which could help in the early detection and treatment of the condition.

The project involves the use of Python for data analysis and machine learning. Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and support vector machines are implemented to analyze voice features and make predictions about the presence of Parkinson's disease. 

In addition to implementing machine learning algorithms, the project also involves conducting a grid search for tuning the parameters of the model. This step is essential for optimizing the performance of the model and improving its predictive power. 

## In short

* Developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of Parkinson's disease based on voice recordings.
* Implemented different machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and support vector machines to analyze voice features and make predictions.
* Conducted a grid search to optimize the parameters of the model and improve its predictive power.
